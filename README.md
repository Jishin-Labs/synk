## Overview

**Synk** merges two powerful tools into one seamless experience:

- **ContractSync** → Smart contract creation, signing, renewal & reminders.  
  - ECTA-compliant digital signatures  
  - Auto-renewals & reminders  
  - Localized templates (ZAR, VAT, SA compliance)

- **Ledgerly** → Lightweight accounting & invoicing.  
  - ZAR + VAT support  
  - PayFast & Stripe integration  
  - Bank CSV import (FNB, Capitec, Standard Bank)

Together they form a **connected workflow**:
